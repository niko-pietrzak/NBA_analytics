# NBA_analytics
Based on types of players in a team we're trying to predict which team is going to make to the playoffs.
To do that I used logistic regression model.

I used two sources of data: https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data where I get the players sizes
and https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_per_game.html where I get players and teams stats.
I edited these in excel I made 2 csv files: 'teams' and 'players'.
